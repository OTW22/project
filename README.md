CHAPTER 1 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
  1.1 	SIWES 
SIWES, which is similar to the SIWES scheme was established by the Federal Government to solve the problem of lack of practical skills preparatory for employment in industries by Nigerian graduates of tertiary institutions.  
  
The scheme exists to expose 400 level students to industry-based skills necessary for a smooth transition from the classroom to the world of work. It affords students of tertiary institution the opportunity of being exposed to the necessary experience in handling machinery and equipment, which may not be available in the educational institutions.  

The Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is the accepted training programme, which is part of the approved Minimum Academic Standard in the various degree programmes for all Nigerian Universities.  The scheme is aimed at bridging the existing gap between theory and practice of Sciences, Agriculture, Medical Sciences (including Nursing), Engineering and Technology, Management, Information and Communication Technology, and other professional educational programs in the Nigerian tertiary institutions
 
1.2 HISTORY OF SIWES
SIWES was established by ITF in 1973 to solve the problem of lack of adequate practical skills preparatory for employment in industries by Nigerian graduates of tertiary institutions. The Scheme exposes students to industry based skills necessary for a smooth transition from the classroom to the world of work. It affords students of tertiary institutions the opportunity of being familiarized and exposed to the needed experience in handling machinery and equipment which are usually not available in the educational institutions. 
Participation in Industrial Training is a well-known educational strategy. Classroom studies are integrated with learning through hands-on work experiences in a field related to the student s academic major and career goals Successful internships foster an experiential learning process that not only promotes career preparation but provides opportunities for learners to develop skills necessary to become leaders in their chosen professions.
One of the primary goals of the SIWES is to help students integrate leadership development into the experiential learning process. Students are expected to learn and develop basic non-profit leadership skills through a mentoring relationship with innovative non-profit leaders. By integrating leadership development activities into the Industrial Training experience, we hope to encourage students to actively engage in non-profit management as a professional career objective.
 However, the effectiveness of the SIWES experience will have varying outcomes based upon the individual student, the work assignment, and the supervisor/mentor requirements. It is vital that each internship position description includes specific written learning objectives to ensure leadership skill development is incorporated. Participation in SIWES has become a necessary pre-condition for the award of Diploma and Degree certificates in specific disciplines in most institutions of higher learning in the country, in accordance with the education policy of government.

       Here the IT students, under the supervision of two IT personnel, assist and resolve problems that are brought in from other departments. When this is done, the status of the problem (either it is resolved or work is still in progress) is logged down both at the helpdesk and in the workshop. Logging down these cases is done for record purposes. This will enable the ICT department to know which problems are predominant in the organization, which users need to go for IT courses for further enlightenment and in general, try to find solutions to problems at hand. Then the computers and/or its peripherals are taken back to their various users. Also, there are cases Then the computers and/or its peripherals are taken back to their various users. 
Also, there are cases where these problems do not need to be brought to the workshop and can be resolved in the various offices in which the complaints came from.


3.2 EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED 
I was shown how to format a hard disk, installing and configuring operating systems on a formatted system, downloading and installation of necessary drivers and installation of other application software. I was placed under the supervision of Mr Obawole Taofik B. In the following month, I was assigned to the NETCOM arm of ICT department under the supervision of Mr. Emmanuel Adeniran, where I learnt different networking topologies, worked with different networking devices like the hubs, switches, routers and network printers. I got to know how to solve some networking problems both on the intranet and the internet. I was also able to identify various components used to develop network connections, like the modem and network cards.                                       
Among the other things I learnt were how to terminate network (twisted pair) cables and how to connect computers to the local area network. How to troubleshoot various networking problems, like when a user has connectivity problem, inability to log on to his or her user account etc. Configuration of wireless connection on laptops and desktops. Configuration of switches, hubs and routers. How to lay network cables. How to install network printers and add it to a system. Adding systems to a domain and creating a network between computers and other peripherals.
I also learnt about different types of server such as proxy, database, and file servers. In addition to this, I understood and practiced how to configure and connects multiple computer systems to access points, in which in turn connects to the server base for connectivity. Learnt how ethernet cables, switches and routers are used for internet connectivity. Understood how Nama uses proxy servers for added privacy over a private network.
Learnt in depth on why and how to troubleshoot computer hardware and its peripherals, troubleshooting is carried out to identify a faulty component or components in a system, this is to ensure that a healthy component is not mistaken for issues. This saves, time, effort and technical skill. Troubleshooting was carried out severally and effectively on different systems resulting in different repairs. For example, a system that keeps turning on but no display was brought for repair at the office. On initial troubleshooting, we found that there was indication of power supply so the power control unit was functioning properly, there was no dusty fans on opening the system so it couldn’t be the cooling fans either. From prior experience, the ram of a computer system has to be in good condition or else there will be no memory allocated for boot up, upon this knowledge, the ram was checked, cleaned with little alcohol and then reseeded properly and this fixed the problem of the system.
Learnt in depth on how the use of computer drivers. Computer drivers are a sort of intermediary between computer hardware and the operating system, this means all hardware come with a driver. A driver depicts how a computer hardware will communicate with the operating system.  It contains a set of files that are important for the functioning of the hardware. For example, I once stumbled on a printer that wasn’t printing eve though it was connected to the computer system properly during my internship, I troubleshot the printer but there was no faulty components with the printer neither the computer, we found out the drivers were outdated and was causing the printer not to function.
Learnt about the functioning of a cmos battery, this component located on the motherboard is responsible for the bios start of a computer system, if the cmos battery runs out of power, fails or is not connected properly, It will lead to incorrect time and date because this information is kept tracked by the cmos battery. This experience was acquired when I came across a system that ad incorrect date and time and didn’t allow users to set the correct date and time. I was taught about the cmos battery with this opportunity and how it is directly related to the bios status of a computer.


Learnt how to install new operating system on a computer. The need to do this can be for numerous reasons, such as; unfriendly interface of previous operating system, infected operating system, slow computer system, etc Specifically learnt how to install windows 11 on outdated computers.

Learnt on how to configure IP address for window using TCP
I was assigned to the BOS ,BIS ,Netcomms and HELPDESK arm of the department, depending on my scheduled shift for the day, where I was taught on the identification of various component of computer hardware, e.g. hard disk, floppy diskette, random access memory (RAM), cmos battery, VGAs, power supply unit, removing and replacing of these hardware components, installation of various software and operating systems where necessary, how to connect various devices (printers and scanners) and other computer peripherals. 

   
 3.2.1 Work done at the helpdesk
	As an intern working in the help desk section of the ICT Department at NAMA, I was involved in first-line IT support for the entire organization. The help desk serves as the primary point of contact for employees reporting technical issues, ranging from hardware malfunctions to software troubleshooting.

3.2.2 Some of the computer components that I familiarized myself with 
The Motherboard
 this is a thin flat piece of circuit board (usually of green or gold color). Everything in the Computer connects, directly or indirectly, to the motherboard. It contains a number of special sockets that accepts various components of the computer. he motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer system that serves as the foundation for all other components. It houses the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random access memory), and other essential hardware, ensuring they can communicate with each other. The motherboard also provides connectors for storage devices (like SSDs and hard drives), graphics cards, and peripherals (such as keyboards, mice, and printers).
In addition to connecting hardware components, the motherboard distributes power from the power supply to various parts of the system. It contains the BIOS firmware, which is responsible for initializing hardware during the boot process and managing system default settings. Essentially, the motherboard acts as the backbone of the computer, enabling different components to work together to perform tasks.
Components on a motherboard.

Read Only Memory (RAM)
 The random access memory stores programs and data currently being used by the CPU. It is measured in bytes, which is measured in megabytes where you have millions of bytes of RAM. The average PC usually has between 32 megabyte/128 megabyte to 1 gigabyte of RAM (modern PCs may have several megabytes). The RAM has a socket that allows it to be placed on the motherboard.

A picture of a typical PC RAM
Hard drive: Hard drives stores programs that are not currently being used by the CPU. Like the RAM, hard drive capacity is measured in megabytes. A typical PC hard drive stores much more data than the RAM and thus can range from 500 megabytes (in very old systems) to more than 75 to 100 gigabyte. Like every other component of the PC, the hard drive has connectors called the EIDE cables. They also have power cables.

DVD/CD ROM Drive: The DVD/CD ROM drives enables access to DVD and CD ROMs. Some PC s come with recordable and or rewritable CD and DVD. They also need power supply via the power cable.
Connectors: These connectors (often called ports) allows for connection of other components of the computer. We have the DB (printers, monitor), DIN (keyboard, mouse), Centronics (printer),

RJ (network interface card, modem), BNC (network interface cards), Audio (speakers, headphones) and USB (keyboards, mouse, printers, disk drives e.t.SSc) connectors, each with its own type of device that it connects to the computer.

Cooling system: Cooling system consists of two or more fans. One fan for the system (CPU), and one for the processor. The CPU will operate more reliably and will have a longer lifespan if the cooling system is working properly.
Power supply: The power supply distributes power to the motherboard and other components in the CPU. The PSU distributes power to key components, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, hard drives, and expansion cards. It also regulates voltage to ensure stable and safe operation, protecting components from power surges or irregularities. A reliable PSU is critical for the overall stability and performance of a computer.
A hub: it is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network. They are generally used to connect computers in a LAN. A hub has many ports in it. A computer which intends to be connected to the network is plugged in to one of these ports
    A hub is a device that acts as a central connection point for computers on a network shown in fig 1.5 below. Every computer plugs into the hub. 
Figure 6A Hub connection
               
switch: Such as the one shown in Fig 1.6 below, performs all of the same basic tasks as a hub, but the switch uses a set of internal logic circuits to establish a dedicated, logical path between the two PCs. This provides for more efficient data transfer without collision which occurs in the hub two PCs.
 This provides for more efficient data transfer without collisions which occurs in the hub. They both have ports for RJ-45 connectors which computers use to connect to the network.

Network Adapter: The Network Adapter is the source through which the computer connects to the network as well as all other computers on the network. A pictorial representation is shown below:
Figure 8 anetwork adaptor

A network (Ethernet) cable with an RJ-45 connector terminated at the end.
The Ethernet cable:  are network cables containing eight wires with different colors. These wires
 are arranged and terminated according to the type of connection needed. We have the straight ended terminated cable, for connecting devices that are dissimilar (e.g computer to hub/switch, switch to hub etc). We also have the cross ended terminated cable, for connecting devices that are the same (e,g computer to computer, switch to switch, hub to hub etc). The colors of the wires are green, orange, blue and brown. Four of these wires have these colors in full while the remaining four have the colors but with stripes of white along it. For straight ended cables, the color code is: White/Orange (i.e. orange color striped with white) followed by full Orange, white/green-blue, white/blue-green, white/brown-brown.
 For cross-ended cables, we have: White/green-green, white/orange-blue, white/blue-orange, white/brown-brown. All these wires are arranged in line and inserted into the RJ-45 connector which is then held in place (crimped) by a crimping device. The diagram is shown below:
